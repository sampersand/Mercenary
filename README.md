# Mercenary

After writing so many programming languages myself, I decided that I won't write a single line of code for this language: Instead, I've hired others to do it for me. (Each person was given a pizza as a reward for their efforts.)

People are not allowed to modify previous people's code, and they are encouraged to write it as terrible as possible.
